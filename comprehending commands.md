### Epic File System Quest
followed instructions on the screen; when directories had a large number of files, found a pattern that the files required are in capitals.

### finding files
I navigated to the root directory and ran a command to search for files named 'flag,' noting down all files where I had access. After checking each, I found the flag by running cat on ./opt/pwndbg/.venv/lib/python3.8/site-packages/pip/_vendor/urllib3/packages/__pycache__/flag."

### linking files
I linked not the flag file with the flag file to get the data of the flag file into the not-the-flag file which I then read using the catflag file
